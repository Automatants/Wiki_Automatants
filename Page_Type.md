### Part with maths

Please write every equations in $LATEX$ instead of using screenshots for equations like this one :
$$z = w_1x_1+w_2x_2+w_3x_3+b \tag{1} $$

### Part with code

Please use this code presentation by specifying the used programming language. Put only the code necessary to understand a notion to avoid overloading the page.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
```

### References

Please, put a maximum amount of references in your page, that guided your understanding of the notion. If there are too many, simply put them on the bottom of the page as footnotes.
Ex : 

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: meaningful!

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
