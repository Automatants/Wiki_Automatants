# Model Complexity
- A simple model is one where $\theta$ has few non-zero parameters.
	-> Only a few features are relevant
	-> $||\theta||_1$ will be small (L1 norm)
	
- A simple model is one where $\theta$ is almost uniform
	-> Few features are significantly more relevant than others.
	->$||\theta||_2^2$ will be small (L2 norm)
