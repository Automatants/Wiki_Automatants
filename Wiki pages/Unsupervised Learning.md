# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is about learning a new representation of the data.

## Dimensionality reduction
Finding a lower-dimensional representation
$$ x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p \implies  x_i \in \mathbb{R}^m \text{ with } m \ll p $$

Why is it useful ?
- Reduces storage space and  ccomputational time
- Remove redundancies
- Curse of dimensionality
- Visualization and interpretability

## Data clustering
Group similar data points together.

Why is it useful?
- Understand general characteristics of the data
- Infer some properties of an object
- Customer Segmentation
- Topic modelinng
- Image segmentation
- Community detection
