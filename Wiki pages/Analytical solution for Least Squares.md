# Analytical solution for Least Squares

It is sometimes possible to find an analytical solution for an optimization problem. This is true for the [[Least-Squares Regression]]

## Idea
- Writing $J(\theta)$ in matrix form.
- Computing its derivative and finding the solution.
- We find : $(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$
