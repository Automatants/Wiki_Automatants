# ImageNet Dataset

ImageNet is a dataset of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images belonging to roughly 22,000 categories. The images were collected from the web and labeled by human labelers using Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing tool. Starting in 2010, as part of the Pascal Visual Object Challenge, an annual competition called the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge  
(ILSVRC) has been held. ILSVRC uses a subset of ImageNet with roughly 1000 images in each of  
1000 categories. In all, there are roughly 1.2 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and 150,000 testing images.
