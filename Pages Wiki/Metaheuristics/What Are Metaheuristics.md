# Metaheuristics
Due to the combinatorial explosion, most NP-Hard optimization problems cannot be solved in human time. There is therefore a need for algorithms that find a *good* solution within finite time.

### Definition
A metaheuristic is an algorithm that tries to find an approximate satisfying solution for an optimization problem. 

### Properties
* Metaheuristics do not guarantee optimality of the solution.
* Metaheuristics are problem-agnostic.
